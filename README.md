cotitan
=======
cotitan is a turn-based, multiplayer game that revolves around killing large
things (titans). While your character is certainly heroic, they aren't heroic
enough to kill a titan on their own! therefore, cotitan is rather team-oriented.
For more information about the game, check out the [wiki pages] (https://github.com/forestbelton/cotitan/wiki).

Dependencies
------------
* Erlang runtime
* A curses library (ncurses or pdcurses should be fine)
* pthreads

Building
--------
A simple `make` should suffice, assuming you have the correct dependencies as
listed above.
